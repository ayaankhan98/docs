### Test Cases in Robonito

Test cases are the core building blocks of Robonito’s automation framework. Each test case represents a specific scenario consisting of defined configurations, steps, and expected outcomes used to validate application behavior. Robonito supports multiple types of test cases, enabling teams to automate different layers of application testing.

Test cases are always created within a test suite, allowing logical grouping based on application modules or features.

### Test Case Types
Robonito supports the following types of test cases, allowing comprehensive automation across different platforms:
- **Web (UI) Test Cases:** Web test cases automate user interactions with web applications. These tests simulate actions such as clicking elements, filling forms, navigating pages, and validating UI behavior in real browsers. [How to create a web test case](/docs/web-testing/create-web-test).
- **API Test Cases:** API test cases validate backend services by testing API endpoints. They help ensure correct request handling, response validation, performance, and reliability of application APIs. [How to create an API test case](/docs/api-testing/create-api-testcase).
- **Mobile Test Cases:** Mobile test cases are used to automate testing for mobile applications. These tests validate functionality, UI behavior, and workflows on mobile devices. [How to create a Mobile test case](/docs/mobile-testing/create-mobile-testcase).
