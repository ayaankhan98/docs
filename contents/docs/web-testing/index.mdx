# Web Testing

Robonito provides a powerful and intuitive way to automate web application testing. With recording, AI-assisted assertions, variables, and flexible execution options, teams can quickly create reliable and maintainable web test cases.

This section covers everything you need to create, configure, execute, and manage Web (UI) tests in Robonito.


## What is Web Testing in Robonito?

Web Testing in Robonito allows you to automate real user interactions within a browser. Robonito captures actions such as clicks, inputs, navigation, and validations, converting them into structured test steps.

Web tests help you:

- Validate UI functionality
- Detect regressions
- Automate repetitive workflows
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility
- Improve release confidence


## Create a Web Test

To begin web testing:

1. Navigate to **Test Cases**
2. Click **Create Test Case**
3. Select:
   - **Type:** Web
   - **Target Suite**
   - **Browser**
   - **Device**
   - **Target URL**
4. Click **Create**

Once created, you can start recording or manually configure steps.


## Record & Playback

Recording is the fastest way to build a web test.


## Start Recording

1. Open the test case
2. Click **Start Recording**
3. Configure:
   - **Browser**
   - **Target URL**
   - **Device resolution**
   - **Authentication (optional)**
4. Click **Start Recording**

A browser launches, and Robonito captures all interactions.

Robonito captures:

- Clicks
- Text inputs

Each interaction is automatically converted into a structured test step.
