### Cloud Execution

Cloud Execution allows you to run test cases on Robonito’s cloud infrastructure instead of your local machine. This execution mode is designed for scalability, reliability, and team-based automation workflows.

Cloud Execution is available as a premium feature.


## Key Characteristics of Cloud Execution

- Test cases are executed on Robonito-managed cloud infrastructure
- No dependency on local system resources
- Provides a consistent and controlled execution environment
- Suitable for large test suites and team-based execution
- Ideal for continuous integration and scheduled runs


### When to Use Cloud Execution

Cloud Execution is recommended when:

- Running tests as part of CI/CD pipelines
- Executing large or complex test suites
- Multiple team members need shared execution environments
- Local system resources are limited
- Tests need to run independently of user machines


### Cloud Execution Availability

If Cloud Execution is not enabled for your account:

- The **Execute** button is disabled
- A message indicates that Cloud Execution is locked
- Options are provided to request access:
  - Contact Email
  - Contact Slack

Once enabled, Cloud Execution becomes selectable in the execution configuration.


### Cloud Execution Behavior

During cloud execution:

- Test steps are executed sequentially on cloud resources
- All assertions (Smart, UI, Page, Content-based) are evaluated
- Execution progress is tracked remotely
- Results are collected and stored centrally


### Execution Report – Cloud Execution

The Execution Report for Cloud Execution provides detailed insights into test runs executed on the cloud. It helps teams monitor test stability, execution performance, and historical trends.

A cloud execution report is generated automatically after each cloud run.


### Report Overview

The top section of the cloud execution report displays:

### Total Runs

Total number of cloud executions for the test case.


### Passed

Number of successful cloud executions.


### Failed

Number of failed cloud executions.


### Average Duration

Average time taken by cloud executions.


### Test Case Health

Test Case Health reflects the stability of the test case based on cloud execution history.

- Calculated using pass/fail ratios
- Helps identify flaky or unstable tests
- Useful for monitoring long-term test reliability


### Execution History

The Execution History table includes details for each cloud execution run.

### Date

Time when the cloud execution was triggered.


### Status

Execution result:

- PASS
- FAIL


### Type

Test case type (Web, API, or Mobile).


### Executed By

User or system that triggered the execution (manual or CI).


### Version

Test case version executed in the cloud.


### Environment

Execution environment:

- CLOUD


### Browser

Browser and version used in cloud execution.


### Screen Size

Viewport resolution used in the cloud run.


### Platform

Cloud execution platform details.


### Runtime

Total execution duration.


## Understanding Cloud Execution Failures

For failed cloud executions:

- Failed steps and assertions are highlighted
- Logs and execution details are available for analysis
- Helps diagnose environment-specific or timing-related issues
