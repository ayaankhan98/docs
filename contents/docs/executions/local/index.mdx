### Local Execution

Local Execution allows you to run test cases directly on your local machine using the installed Robonito setup. This execution mode is primarily used for test development, debugging, and quick validation.


### Key Characteristics of Local Execution

- Test cases are executed on the user’s local system
- Uses locally installed browsers and configurations
- Suitable for rapid feedback during test creation
- Ideal for debugging failed steps and assertions
- Does not require cloud infrastructure


### When to Use Local Execution

Local Execution is recommended when:

- Developing or recording new test cases
- Debugging failed steps or assertions
- Validating changes before committing tests
- Running tests in a controlled local environment


### Local Execution Behavior

During local execution:

- Test steps are executed sequentially
- Execution status is updated in real time
- Logs and results are generated immediately after execution


### Execution Report – Local Execution

The Execution Report provides a detailed summary of all test case runs executed using Local Execution. It helps analyze execution results, identify failures, and monitor test stability over time.

The report is automatically generated after each local execution.

### Report Overview

The top section of the report displays key execution metrics:

### Total Runs

Shows the total number of times the test case has been executed locally.


### Passed

Indicates the number of successful executions.


### Failed

Indicates the number of failed executions.


### Average Duration

Displays the average time taken to complete the test case across all local runs.


### Test Case Health

Test Case Health represents the overall stability of the test case based on historical local executions.

- Calculated as a percentage of passed versus failed runs
- Higher values indicate stable tests
- Lower values highlight flaky or failing tests


### Execution History

The Execution History table provides detailed information for each local execution run.

### Date

Time when the test case was executed.


### Status

Result of the execution:

- PASS
- FAIL


### Type

Test case type (e.g., Web).


### Executed By

User who initiated the execution.


### Version

Version of the test case at the time of execution.


### Environment

Execution environment:

- LOCAL


### Browser

Browser and version used for execution.


### Screen Size

Viewport resolution used during execution.


### Platform

Operating system on which the test was executed.


### Runtime

Total time taken to complete the execution.


### Understanding Failures

For failed local executions:

- The execution status is marked as FAILED
- Failed steps and assertions are highlighted
- Detailed failure information is available for debugging

This helps quickly identify and fix issues during local test execution.
