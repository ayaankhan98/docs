### Test Case Execution

Robonito allows you to execute test cases using configurable execution environments. The **Execution Configuration** dialog enables you to define where and how a test case should run before starting execution.

This dialog appears when you click the **Execute** button on a test case.

### Execution Configuration

The **Execution Configuration** panel provides options to control the execution location and environment.


### Runs On *

Select where you want to execute the test case.

### Local

Executes the test case on your local machine using the installed Robonito setup.

Local execution is ideal for:

- Development
- Debugging
- Quick test validation


### Environment *

Select the environment in which the test case should be executed.

### Local

Executes the test using locally configured settings and resources.


### Cloud Execution (Premium)

Cloud execution is available as a **premium feature**.

When **Cloud Execution** is selected:

- The **Execute** button is disabled
- A prompt is displayed to upgrade your plan

You can request access using:

- Contact Email
- Contact Slack

Cloud execution enables scalable, remote execution without relying on local resources.


### Execute Test Case

After selecting the execution configuration:

1. Review the **Runs On** and **Environment** values
2. Click the **Execute** button

Once execution starts:

- The test case begins running with the selected configuration
- Execution progress is tracked in real time
- Results are generated after completion


### Execution Behavior

During execution, Robonito:

- Runs each test step sequentially
- Marks steps as **passed** or **failed**
- Captures execution logs and status


### Execution Status & Results

After execution completes:

- Each step shows its execution status
- Failed steps highlight the reason for failure
- Assertion results are displayed clearly
- Execution data is available for review and debugging


### Why Execution Configuration Matters

Execution configuration ensures:

- Tests run in the correct environment
- Predictable and repeatable results
- Controlled execution behavior
- Flexibility between local and cloud execution
