# Execution Reports

The Execution Reports section in Robonito provides a centralized view of all test executions. It allows you to monitor test activity, track failures, analyze execution trends, and review detailed results.

Reports help teams maintain visibility into automation performance and quickly identify failing tests.

## Execution Trend Graph

The chart visualizes test runs over time.

It displays executions categorized by:

- GithubCheckRun
- Schedule
- Suite
- Testcase

The graph helps you:

- Identify execution frequency
- Detect spikes in failures
- Track activity trends across days
- Monitor automation health


## Failed Tests Panel

On the right side, the Failed Tests panel highlights recently failed test cases.

Each failed entry shows:

- Test case name
- Suite name
- Time of failure
- Failure reason
- Environment (e.g., LOCAL)
- Test type (WEB, API, etc.)
- Tags (if applied)

You can:

- Click **Show more** to expand failure details
- Click **view logs** to inspect execution logs

This allows quick debugging without navigating through full reports.


## Filters

Robonito provides filtering options to refine report data:

- Status (Passed, Failed, In Progress)
- Environment (Local, Cloud)
- Execution Type (Test case, Suite, Schedule)

Filters help narrow down execution data for analysis.
### Download

Allows downloading execution logs or reports.

## Viewing Execution Details

Clicking on an execution entry opens detailed information, including:

- Step-by-step execution results
- Assertion results
- Failure messages
- Runtime data
- Logs

This enables deep inspection for debugging.


## Failed Execution Example

In case of failure (as shown in your UI):

**Example:**

Visual assertion FAILED check diff and actual image

This indicates:

- A visual comparison mismatch
- UI change detected
- Assertion failure during execution

Users can inspect logs and screenshots to determine root cause.


## Benefits of Execution Reports

Execution Reports allow teams to:

- Monitor automation activity
- Track test stability
- Identify flaky tests
- Review execution history
- Debug failures efficiently
- Maintain quality assurance transparency


## Best Practices for Reports

- Regularly review failed tests panel
- Monitor test case health trends
- Use filters to isolate unstable tests
- Investigate recurring visual or CSS assertion failures
- Schedule automated runs and monitor report trends
