### UI / Element-Based Assertions

UI / Element-Based Assertions are used to validate the presence, visibility, count, and styling of specific UI elements on a page. These assertions ensure that UI components are rendered correctly and behave as expected during test execution.

The **Add Assertion** dialog appears when you select **UI / Element-Based** under the assertion type while recording or editing a test step.

### Choose Assertion Type – UI / Element-Based

UI / Element-Based assertions focus on validating DOM elements rather than page content.

Robonito supports the following UI assertion types:


### Element Exists

Asserts that a specific element exists in the DOM.

- Validates that the element is present, regardless of visibility
- Useful for ensuring required elements are rendered

**Use case:**  
Verify that a header, button, or container exists on the page.


### Element Visible

Asserts that a specific element is visible to the user.

- Ensures the element is displayed on the screen
- Useful for validating UI readiness before interactions

**Use case:**  
Confirm that a button or text is visible before clicking or reading it.


### Element Count

Validates the number of elements matching a selector.

### Configuration Options

- **Expected count value**

**Use case:**  
Verify the number of items in a list, table rows, or repeated UI components.


### CSS Assertion

Validates the value of a specific CSS property for an element.

### Configuration Options

- **CSS property name**
- **Expected property value**

**Use case:**  
Ensure correct styling, such as color, font size, or visibility state.


### Assertion Configuration

Once a UI assertion type is selected, the **Configuration** panel becomes active.

Depending on the selected assertion, you can configure:

- **Expected Text*** – The expected value associated with the element
- **Match Type** – How the value should be matched (e.g., Exact Match)
- **Case Sensitive** – Enable for case-sensitive matching

These settings define how Robonito evaluates the assertion during execution.


### Add Assertion

After configuring the assertion:

1. Review the selected UI assertion and configuration
2. Click **Add Assertion**

The assertion is attached to the selected test step and evaluated during test execution. Results are displayed as **pass** or **fail** in the execution report.
