### Smart Assertion

Smart Assertion allows you to define validations using simple, human-readable descriptions. Instead of manually configuring assertion rules, you describe what should be true about the selected UI element, and **Robonito** automatically interprets and applies the appropriate validation logic.

This dialog appears when you choose **Smart Assertion** during recording or while editing a test step.

### Create Smart Assertion

The **Create Assertion** dialog enables you to define intelligent assertions using natural language.


### Assertion Description

Enter a clear description of what should be true about the selected element.

**Examples:**

- “The login button should be visible and clickable”
- “The error message should contain the text ‘Invalid credentials’”
- “The submit button should be disabled”

You can enter up to **500 characters**.


### Instructions for Writing Smart Assertions

To create an effective Smart Assertion:

1. Select the target UI element on the page first
2. Describe what you want to verify about the element
3. Use clear and specific language such as:
   - `should be visible`
   - `should be clickable`
   - `should contain text`
4. Save the assertion once the description is complete

The assertion is automatically evaluated during test execution.


### Save Assertion

Click **Save Assertion** to attach the smart assertion to the selected test step.

During execution, Robonito evaluates the assertion and marks it as **passed** or **failed** in the execution report.


### Benefits of Smart Assertions

Smart Assertions provide:

- Faster assertion creation
- Reduced manual configuration
- Clear, readable validations
- Improved test maintainability
